Id Capture Session
=====================

.. module:: scandit.datacapture.id
  :android-package: com.scandit.datacapture.id.capture

.. class:: IdCaptureSession
  @objc@ SDCIdCaptureSession : NSObject
  :available: android=6.2, ios=6.2

  The id capture session is responsible for keeping CapturedId data.

  The id capture session should only be accessed from within the callbacks to which it is provided
  as an argument. It is not safe to access it from anywhere else since it may be concurrently
  modified. However, the captured id returned by the session can be used outside the callbacks.

  .. property:: CapturedId NewlyCapturedId { get; }
    :available: android=6.2, ios=6.2

    Parsed data from a document recognized in the last frame.

  .. property:: long FrameSequenceId { get; }
    @objc@ @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger frameSequenceId
    :available: android=6.2, ios=6.2

    The identifier of the current frame sequence.

    .. important::
     As long as there is no interruptions of frames coming from the camera, the
     :prop:`IdCaptureSession.FrameSequenceId` will stay the same.
