    it's not recognized. Default is |false|.

  .. method:: void SetShouldPassImageTypeToResult(IdImageType type, bool shouldPass)
    @objc@ - (BOOL)resultShouldContainImageForImageType:(SDCIdImageType)imageType
    :available: android=6.2, ios=6.2

    Sets whether an :type:`IdCapture` created with these settings should extract an image (specified
    by the given type) from recognized documents and return it as part of :type:`CapturedId`. Note
